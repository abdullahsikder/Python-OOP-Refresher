# Python-OOP-Refresher
Some files I wrote to help get a good fresher on Object Oriented Programming with Python and VTK. 

myIren is a great fresher of Inheritance and Encapsulation, where it inherits all the modules of vtkInteractorTrackBallCamera, and create
a more customized interaction. The underscore before all of the modules make it such that they are restricted and can not be used as 
object modules.
